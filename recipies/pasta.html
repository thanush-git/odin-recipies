    <h1>Pasta</h1>

    <p> Pasta, a staple of Italian cuisine, is a versatile and beloved dish enjoyed worldwide. Made primarily from durum wheat flour and water, it comes in numerous shapes and sizes, each suited to different types of sauces and culinary uses. From long, thin strands like spaghetti and linguine to short, tube-like shapes such as penne and rigatoni, pasta's variety allows for endless creativity in the kitchen. Its mild flavor and firm texture make it the perfect canvas for a range of ingredients, from rich tomato-based sauces and creamy Alfredo to fresh pesto and simple olive oil dressings.</p>
    <p>Cooking pasta is straightforward yet requires a few key steps to achieve the perfect al dente texture, where the pasta is tender but still slightly firm to the bite. The process involves boiling the pasta in plenty of salted water, then draining it just before it reaches the desired tenderness, as it continues to cook slightly from residual heat. Pasta can be served immediately with a chosen sauce, incorporated into baked dishes like lasagna, or used as a base for salads. Its simplicity, paired with the ability to absorb and complement a variety of flavors, makes pasta a cherished ingredient in kitchens around the world.</p>
