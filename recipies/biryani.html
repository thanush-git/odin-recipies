    <img src="img/biryani-img.jpg" alt="picture of biryani" height="400" width="400">
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is a popular dish that combines basmati rice with meat, vegetables, and a blend of spices. The dish is known for its rich flavors and fragrant aroma, making it a favorite in many households. Biryani can be made with chicken, beef, lamb, or as a vegetarian version, offering a wide variety of options for different tastes.</p>
    <p>The key to a perfect biryani lies in the layers of ingredients and the slow cooking process, which allows the flavors to meld together beautifully. The rice is typically cooked separately from the meat or vegetables, and then both are layered together with spices and herbs. This method ensures that each grain of rice is infused with the flavors of the spices and the meat or vegetables, resulting in a delicious and satisfying meal.</p>
